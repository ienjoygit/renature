# `renature`

`renature` is a physics-based animation library for React focused on modeling natural world forces like gravity, friction, and fluid dynamics, exposed as a set of React hooks.

## ✨Features

- 🎣 A small set of declarative React hooks for animating with ease.
- 🌌 Support for non-traditional physics-based animations using gravity, friction, fluid resistance, and more.
- 🧮 Mathematically accurate and type-safe physics, powered by [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/).
- 🔁 Start, stop, delay, and loop animations with our Controller API.
- 0️⃣ A tiny animation library with zero dependencies!

## 📃Documentation

Our documentation is currently in progress and will be available as a separate site soon. You can view it in its current state in our [docs folder](/docs/content/getting-started.md).

## Maintenance Status

**Active:** Formidable is actively working on this project, and we expect to continue for work for the foreseeable future. Bug reports, feature requests and pull requests are welcome.
