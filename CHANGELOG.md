## v0.9.1

This release fixes bugs uncovered in the new `repeat` API outlined in [#124](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/issues/124).

## Fixed

- Specifying an even number for `repeat` no longer leads to an incorrect "jump" to the `to` value specified in the hook config. PR by @parkerziegler [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/pull/126).
- Erroneously specifying a `string` value for `repeat` no longer results in an animation extending beyond its bounds. While this will be caught at compile-time by TypeScript users, it's an easy mistake for JavaScript users to make, so we guard against it at runtime. PR by @parkerziegler [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/pull/126).

## v0.9.0

This release introduces a new API to `renature` hooks ‚Äî the `repeat` API.

Previously, the only way to run an animation more than one iteration was to use the `infinite` parameter, set to `true`. However, this doesn't work for cases where you want your animation to run a set number of iterations before coming to a smooth stop.

To support this, the `repeat` parameter replaces the `infinite` parameter in `renature` hooks. You can still create an infinite animation by specifying `repeat: Infinity`, but you can also animate between `from` and `to` a set number of times. For example, the following configuration:

```typescript
const [props] = useFluidResistance<HTMLDivElement>({
  from: {
    boxShadow: '20px 20px 0px teal, -20px -20px 0px orange',
  },
  to: {
    boxShadow: '-20px -20px 0px orange, 20px 20px 0px teal',
  },
  config: {
    mass: 20,
    rho: 20,
    area: 20,
    cDrag: 0.1,
    settle: false,
  },
  repeat: 2,
});
```

indicates that, after the animating element has finished its first animation cycle (e.g. has animated from the `from` state to the `to` state), it should repeat the animation two additional times.

### Changed

- ‚ö†Ô∏è The `infinite` parameter for `renature` hooks has been deprecated in favor of `repeat`. You can now repeat a `renature` animation declaratively a set number of iterations before stopping. To run an animation infinitely, specify `repeat: Infinity`. PR by @parkerziegler [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/pull/123).

[Diff](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/compare/v0.8.2...v0.9.0)

## v0.8.2

This release is a small, internals-only, performance-related release. It consolidates the core logic of the hooks `renature` exposes into an internal `useForceGroup` hook that all hooks compose.

### Changed

All hooks now compose the internal-only `useForceGroup` hook to centralize animation logic. PR by @parkerziegler [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/pull/122).

[Diff](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/compare/v0.8.1...v0.8.2)

## v0.8.1

This release fixes a small bug related to the use of the optional index parameter in the `controller.set` API. `controller.set` with the index parameter specified now works as documented.

### Fixed

- The `controller.set` API correctly targets an animating element when called with the index parameter specified. PR by @parkerziegler [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/pull/116).

[Diff](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/compare/v0.8.0...v0.8.1)

## v0.8.0

This release adds support for a `set` method on the `controller` returned by a `renature` hook. You can use `controller.set` to animate an element to any CSS state at any time.

To use the `controller.set` API, just call `controller.set` with an object containing the CSS properties you want to animate to. For example, to animate an element to a random `scale` and `opacity` value every 2 seconds, you can do the following:

```typescript
import React, { useEffect, FC } from 'react';
import { useFriction } from 'renature';

export const FrictionSet: FC = () => {
  const [props, controller] = useFriction<HTMLDivElement>({
    from: {
      opacity: 0,
    },
    to: {
      opacity: 1,
    },
    config: {
      mu: 0.5,
      mass: 300,
      initialVelocity: 10,
    },
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      // Call controller.set with a random scale transform and opacity!
      controller.set({
        transform: `scale(${Math.random()})`,
        opacity: Math.random(),
      });
    }, 2000);

    return () => {
      clearInterval(intervalId);
    };
  }, [controller]);

  return <div className="mover mover--magenta" {...props} />;
};
```

The `controller.set` API is an imperative escape hatch to allow for orchestrating more complex animations after the initial declarative animation has run. You can also animate to new states simply by updating the `to` property of the hook definition.

### Added

- A `set` method is now available on `controller` to imperatively animate to a new CSS state. PRs by @parkerziegler [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/pull/107) and [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/pull/112).

### Fixed

- [`eslint-plugin-import`](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import) was added to standardize `import` statements across the codebase. PR by @jzandag [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/pull/110).

[Diff](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/compare/v0.7.2...v0.8.0)

## v0.7.2

This release improves the way `renature` parses and interpolates CSS transforms. Previously, if you specified multiple transforms in a different order in your `from` and `to` configuration, `renature` would incorrectly interpolate values.

```typescript
// This would yield unexpected results!
{
  from: {
    transform: 'translateX(10px) skewY(3deg)',
  },
  to: {
    transform: 'skewY(6deg) translateX(20px)'
  }
}
```

With the above configuration, `renature` would try to interpolate between the `translateX` and `skewY` properties rather than matching `translateX` and `skewY` configurations separately. This release adds a fix for this behavior, so you can specify your transforms in any order you like!

### Fixed

- CSS transforms with multiple properties are now matched based on transform property rather than order. PR by @parkerziegler [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/pull/105).

[Diff](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/compare/v0.7.1...v0.7.2)

## v0.7.1

This release fixes a subset of issues introduced by the animation caching logic added in v0.7.0. Animations with cached values would not restart from scratch on configuration change due to incorrect cache invalidation logic. This release fixes that behavior, alongside improving TypeScript definitions, optimizating internals, and adding more extensive unit and integration tests.

All changes in this release, with the exception of some TypeScript improvements, are internal and will not affect existing code.

### Fixed

- The animation cache for a `renature` hook is now cleared on animation end. This allows animations to be restarted on configuration change. PR by @parkerziegler [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/pull/103). Fixes [#101](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/issues/101).
- `use<Force>Group` hooks now properly handle generics to specify the type of HTML or SVG element being animated. Fixed as part of this PR by @parkerziegler [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/pull/102/files).

[Diff](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/compare/v0.7.0...v0.7.1)

## v0.7.0

This release adds better support for interrupted and reactive animations. When an animation is interrupted mid-flight (say, by a change in its `to` parameter or part of its physics `config`), it will begin animating from its curernt position to the new target rather than restarting at its `from` definition. There are no changes to the public API.

### Changed

- Interrupted and reactive animations now start from the cached state of the currently animating object rather than from their `from` config. PR by @parkerziegler [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/pull/90).

[Diff](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/compare/v0.6.3...v0.7.0)

## v0.6.3

This release focuses on an internal migration to ReScript, the new build toolchain for Reason and BuckleScript.

### Changed

- `renature` now uses ReScript (`bs-platform` > @8). PR by @parkerziegler [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/pull/87).
- Enhanced function return types for internals were added in this release. PR by @parkerziegler [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/pull/88).

[Diff](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/compare/v0.6.2...v0.6.3)

## v0.6.2

This release fixes issues around the scope of `controller`. v0.6.0 introduced the ability to animate n elements in a single hook instance. However, when using multiple `renature` hooks in the same React tree, calling `controller.start`, `controller.stop`, and `controller.pause` applied to all animating elements, not to _just_ the subset of animating elements created by their corresponding hook. This is fixed in v0.6.2 üåü!

### Fixed

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure `controller`'s behavior is scoped to act only on the animating elements created by the corresponding hook. PR by @parkerziegler [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/pull/80).

[Diff](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/compare/v0.6.1...v0.6.2)

## v0.6.1

This release includes a critical fix for a bug introduced in v0.6.0. Our Bubl√© configuration had `dangerousForOf` transpilation configured, so `for...of` loops operating on `Set`s were incorrectly transpiled, causing animations never to run. This release removes compilation of `for...of` loops since all modern browsers support the syntax for operating on iterable data structures.

### Fixed

- Remove `dangerousForOf` flag in Bubl√© config. PR by @parkerziegler [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/pull/75).

[Diff](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/compare/v0.6.0...v0.6.1)

## v0.6.0

In this release, we add support for `use<Force>Group` hooks for all three major forces covered by `renature` ‚Äì friction, gravity, and fluid resistance. These hooks allow you to animate n elements in a single call to `requestAnimationFrame` and to manipulate the physics parameters and configuration applied to each of them.

### Added

- ‚ú® Add `useFrictionGroup`, `useGravityGroup`, and `useFluidResistanceGroup` hooks. PR by @parkerziegler [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/pull/74).
- ‚ú® Add `pause` method to `controller`. This allows users to pause an animation without removing the animating node from the tracked set of animating elements. PR by @parkerziegler [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/pull/74).

### Fixed

- Previously, calls to `controller.start` would always register a new `requestAnimationFrame` callback even if an existing callback was actively executing. We now check if there's an existing `requestAnimationFrame` callback registered and, if so, update the data referenced by that callback rather than registering a new callback. This prevents n calls to `requestAnimationFrame` being queued before each paint.

[Diff](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/compare/v0.5.0...v0.6.0)

## v0.5.0

In this release, we add support for the `disableHardwareAcceleration` parameter to `renature` hooks. By default, `renature` will attempt to push compatible animations to the GPU (primarily `transform` and `opacity`). If you would like to prevent this behavior, specify `disableHardwareAcceleration: true` in your hooks configuration.

### Added

- ‚ú® Add support for GPU compositing of `transform` animations. PR by @parkerziegler [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/pull/68).

[Diff](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/compare/v0.4.1...v0.5.0)

## v0.4.1

In this release, we expose the `onFrame` and `onAnimationComplete` APIs for the `useGravity` hook. These were accidentally missed in the v0.4.0 release üò±.

### Fixed

- Ensure `onFrame` and `onAnimationComplete` supplied to `useGravity` are picked up and applied in the lifecycle of an animation. PR by @parkerziegler [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/pull/67).

[Diff](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/compare/v0.4.0...v0.4.1)

## v0.4.0

In this release, we add a few new APIs to `renature` to fix some pain points identified by community members. The most notable of these are `onFrame` and `onAnimationComplete` callbacks that can be provided to `renature` hooks.

‚ö†Ô∏è **There are also some breaking changes in this release.** ‚ö†Ô∏è See more details below on how to safely migrate your code.

### Added

- ‚ú® An `onFrame` callback can now be provided to `renature` hooks, which allows you to execute some logic on each call to `requestAnimationFrame`. The callback is handed a single argument, `progress`, which is a number between 0 and 1 representing your progress from the `from` state to the `to` state. PR by @parkerziegler [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/pull/60).
- ‚ú® An `onAnimationComplete` callback can now be provided to `renature` hooks, which allows you to execute logic when an animation ends. This behaves similarly to adding a listener on the DOM's [native `animationend` event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/animationend_event). If a `renature` animation is stopped or unmounted before it has completed, this ca llback will _not_ be executed. PR by @parkerziegler [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/pull/60).
- ‚ú® Default configs have been added for all hooks. You'll now get a default physics config loaded if you don't specify a `config` field on your hook! PR by @parkerziegler [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/pull/62).

### Changed

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Breaking Change** `controller.stop` is now the canonical way to stop or pause a `renature` animation. Previously, if you started an animation by calling `controller.start`, you could only stop or pause it by accessing a returned stop function.

```js
const { stop } = controller.start();
```

Now, you can just call `controller.stop()`. This codifies and simplifies the API ‚Äì when you want to imperatively start / resume an animation, use `controller.start`. When you want to stop or pause an animation, whether it was initiated on mount or by `controller.start`, just use `controller.stop`. PR by @parkerziegler [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/pull/62).

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Breaking Change** The `immediate` flag was renamed to `pause` and the logic behind it is now inverted. If `pause` is set to `true`, the animation will not start running until `controller.start` has been called or if the component re-renders and `pause` evaluates to `false`. PR by @parkerziegler [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/pull/62).

[Diff](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/compare/v0.3.0...v0.4.0)

## v0.3.0

In this release, we add support for using `renature` in Node.js environments for server-side rendering. Previously, using `renature` in server-rendered React applications would result in a runtime error.

### Fixed

- Fallback to `Date.now` in lieu of `performance.now` in Node.js environments when tracking frame timestamps in `rAF`. PR by @parkerziegler [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/pull/54).

[Diff](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/compare/v0.2.1...v0.3.0)

## v0.2.1

In this release, we allow users to supply their own value for `G`, the Universal Gravitational Constant, in the configuration of `useGravity` and `useGraviyt2D` hooks. This allows users to achieve similar animation effects without needing to provide extremely large mass values for the `mover` and `attractor`.

### Added

- ‚ú® A user-configurable `G` parameter for the `useGravity` and `useGravity2D` hooks. PR by @parkerziegler [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/pull/50).

[Diff](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/compare/v0.2.0...v0.2.1)

## v0.2.0

In this release, we added type support for animating SVG elements, normalize our parser and interpolator structure, and include better support complex CSS properties like `transform` and `box-shadow`. We also released a new iteration of our docs site on `react-static` v7 ‚Äì live [here](https://formidable.com/open-source/renature).

### Added

- Type support for SVG elements. PR by @parkerziegler [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/pull/37).
- ‚ú® Add support for `box-shadow` as an animatable CSS property. PR by @parkerziegler [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/pull/41).

### Fixed

- Normalize parser and interpolator structure and move them to separate directories. PR by @parkerziegler [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/pull/42).
- Improvements to our docs site and a migration to `react-static` v7. PR by @parkerziegler [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/pull/46).

[Diff](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/renature/compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.0)

## v0.1.0

This release represents the first publish of `renature`!
